# Welcome to the Compact Library

## About the Library

The Compact Library was created to be a light-weight container of functions, algoritms and styles that Developers or Technologist can have quick access to so they can spend more time designing and developing solutions to problems than have to also worry about how to implement the solutions.

The Library is written in both JavaScript and Python, LESS was used to create the styles. Our hope was that any Developer can access this Library so, a lot of time was spent in comments and documentation of each implementation.

## What you will find

This library was designed with the hope to package as many functions and algorithms that address general to complex implementation faced in development.

Since the library was written in JavaScript and Python. You will find the listings of mathematical and science formulas, you will also get algorithms like sort, handling date adn time, and and so on.

The styles are written in LESS to make it easier to add functionality and to create more compact and specific styles for Web Developers.
